**Ticketosaur is a musician box office and a ticket selling website, created as a database project**

The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  create a platform for music and concert lovers, as well as selling tickets and giving information about upcoming concerts and the musicians.

We provide the latest news about concerts, musicians and much more to our users. We also inform our users before any concerts come out and ticket are sold out on our news page so that they do not miss out on anything!

People can create a profile, change their settings whenever they want, check out musicians list, the latest news and everything about concerts if they would like to. They can learn more about their favorite musicians, their favorite concert areas and expand their knowledge.

We provide more than you ever need!
